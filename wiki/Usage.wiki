== Simulator Summary ==
1. This is a functional simulator (no timing simulation)

2. It supports both big-endian and little-endian, but only work for binaries generated by the cross compiler come with sesc utils

3. It does not support system calls

4. The size of stack is set to be 8M.

5. It stores the current register file and memory dump into a log file every 10000000 instructions. When running the simulator, you have the option to start from existing log files.

== Usage ==

The simulator supports the following arguments:

-f filename: Gives the name of the binary to simulator. (mandatory)

-e endian: Gives the endian of the binary ("little" or "big") (optional)

-r filename: Gives the checkpoint file that you want to restore from. (optional)

Example:
./SimpleMIPS.py -f test -e big -r log
